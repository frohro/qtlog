LOAD DATA INFILE '/local/access_log' INTO TABLE tbl_name
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"' ESCAPED BY '\\'


To reload the table, use and restore with LOAD DATA INFILE 'file_name' REPLACE ...

keyword causes old records to be replaced with new ones when a new record duplicates an
old record on a unique key value.
